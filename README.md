## ABOUT THE APP
It's a chat app. Plain and simple. Don't over think it, we sure didn't. From the welcome page you can choose to register as a new user
which will then prompt you to login, then it will redirect you to the chat room. Or you can simply, "Get Started" and be logged in as 
a anonymous user. Once in the chat room you can add emojis from the drop down box or search for cool gifs in the Giphy drop down box. Also if you hate the color scheme we chose for the page, change it! we ain't judging. Just click on any color on top of the chat 
window. Hey, we just want you to have fun!
